# Ontological engine

The Python package `ontological`: jobs, the answer agent, the Claude gateway, the embedder and the bundled Postgres lifecycle. See [ARCHITECTURE.md §10](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#10-packaging-and-repository-layout) for the planned layout.

Managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on Python 3.12. From this directory:

```sh
uv sync                    # create .venv with the dev tools
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright
uv run pytest
```

Contract tests that spawn your logged-in `claude` (and spend a little quota) are skipped unless `ONTOLOGICAL_CONTRACT=1` is set: `ONTOLOGICAL_CONTRACT=1 uv run pytest tests/contract`. `ONTOLOGICAL_CONTRACT_MODEL` picks the model (default `haiku`).
